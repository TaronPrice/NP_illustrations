  <p>“Illustrating art to relate to us” – Nina NP</p>
  <p>
    Illustrations was established mid Pandemic in June 2020 by Nina Price, a
    self taught digital artist and illustrator based in New Jersey.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main mission of NP.Illustrations is to always represent, celebrate,
    uplift and empathize with Black/Brown culture and people. I want my
    illustrations to connect and bring a sense of being seen to art.
